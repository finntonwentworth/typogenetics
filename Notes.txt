The user enters a string. 
I check that it is valid 
Once that is done, I determine the instructions and therefore the folding pattern of the string 
To do this, I scan the elements of the user's string 2 bases at a time, and decode an instruction. 
	I do not store this value, just print it. 
		I should store this value so that I can quickly start performing operations
			This could be an element of a returned struct by the function 
				struct decoded_strand s {
					char instructions[3*STRAND_SIZE];
					char folding_pattern[STRAND_SIZE];
				};
	I store in a local array the folding direction (r,l,s) 

I want the decoding function to return a struct whose elements are two arrays: 
	The list of instructions
	The folding pattern
I can store these returned values into my user_strand struct 

Then I can have a function which accepts the folding pattern to determine the starting position
Once the starting position is determined, I begin executing instructions sequentially starting on that base  
A function will read in 3 elements of the instruction array, determine the relevant instruction, then call the function
	hmm this will need some thinking- don't do a huge conditional
